# Truths to Frame Your Mindset
- Give them a big God. The worst issues of our day stem from our belief that people are big and God is small. Exalt Christ. Humble sinners. Serve the saints!
- We preach for an audience of one. [^6]
- Imagine you're in a conversation with a 14-year-old. Keep things simple. 
- Your goal is not for them to think much of you, but much of Jesus. Show them Christ. 
- Don't just teach them, teach them how to teach themselves. Show them where you got it in the word and how. The more you equip them to read the word, the more they can discover these things themselves and feed themselves.
- Show them how you found it in the word. Don't give them a fish, show them how to fish.
- What do you have that you have not received?
- Oh to preach believingly! Think of how you can empower the saints by stirring them up to godly affection through this. Consider how they could grow through discernment by your careful preaching. You have gifts where they are lacking.
- "In your teaching, show integrity, dignity, and sound speech that cannot be condemned ‚Ä¶ " Titus 2:7-8
- "Prepare carefully, and preach freely" - MLJ
- Prepare and preach on Sunday as if God is totally for you.¬† He wants your message to advance his kingdom as much as you do, in fact he wants to use your message in more ways and for more of His Glory than you do. Be excited brother.

# Tips For Sunday Morning
- Examples of and tips for good hand gestures:
	- Al Mohler, president of SBTS
	- Jason Allen, President of MBTS
	- Craig Groeschel ‚Ä¶ ? (A good communicator, not a good preacher) "Don't touch your face."
	- Root your feet. Do broad gestures[^3]
	- Watch some of these men on mute, and observe their hand gestures.
	- For improvement, you can watch yourself on video and turn the volume off
-  Suggestions based off of Matt Abraham's adive (Stanford professor)[^1]:
{ #c5ee44}

	- **Greet Your Nervousness and Reframe it:** Say to yourself: *"You feel nervous it makes sense you feel nervous. You are about to do something of consequence and importance."* 
	- **Visualize to Desensitize:** Visualize yourself in the space giving the speech successfully; research shows this can help.
	- **Reframe as a conversation:** You are not reciting something; you are explaining something for the benefit of others.
	- **Serve Your Audience:** See yourself as a servant of God and of the crowd. This-is-not-about-you. It's about God.
	- **Deep Belly Breaths:** Take a few before you go on stage.
	- **Warm Up your Voice:** The physical means which God will use to speak through you are your vocal cords. Stretch them just like a runner stretches before a race.
	- **Dare to Be Dull:** Improv suggestion. Don't be afraid of sounding "boring." If what you are saying is truth, then that is enough.
- *3 Questions to Center Yourself Before Stepping on Stage* O.C.
	- **Do you love these people?** (You are here to serve).
	- **Do you believe the spirit works through the Gospel and that the Gospel is the power of God?** (Spurgeon would say with every step up to the pulpit "I believe in the Holy Spirit").
	- **Do you want them to see more of yourself, or more of Jesus?** (This can relieve so much anxiety or worry because it is not about you).
- Pre preaching routine. ü†≠ 
	- The Above 3 questions. 
	- Pray for people by name.  
	- Visualize yourself walking to the church, walking to the pulpit, and preaching successfully. 
	- I also add personal steps at the top of my manuscript.

# Practical Preparation Thoughts Quotes

* Try this 2-minute drill after your research stage 
<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



- "do a similar thing when I study for a message. I study for 6-10 hours, then grab a piece of paper and say, ‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôm walking to the pulpit (does anyone say ‚Äúpulpit anymore‚Äù?) in two minutes and I can‚Äôt take anything with me but an outline. Okay, Brian, you have two minutes to write down your message in outline form. GO!‚Äù" ([View Highlight]) 

</div></div>



<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



- "Elsewhere Broadus appropriately cautioned, ‚ÄúBe faithful and fearless, but skillful and affectionate.‚Äù" ([Location¬†5145]) 

</div></div>


>[!info] 
>"The steps preachers take in preparing messages vary according to the - personality of the preacher, the time available, the nature of the occasion, the type of sermon, the prior knowledge the preacher has of the text, and many other factors. Still, general guidance is helpful as preachers begin developing their own personal approach to preparing sermons."

>[!info] 
>Sometimes this guidance comes in colloquial terms: "I read myself full, think myself clear, pray myself hot, and then let myself go." Other times the guidance receives more academic treatment: "Read the text, research the material, then focus everything on a single idea." The following preparation pyramid captures the essence of these formulas while emphasizing ideas central to expository preaching as defined in this book." 
 Bryan Chapell, 344

>[!info] "Read the text 50x, at least. Then you can go to the commentaries and you'll find out that what you've got is better than what they've got!"

>[!info] 
>Prepare yourself as much as you prepare the message. 

‚¨á Random order

-  **Questions to ask if preaching at an unknown church:** Translation the congregation is used to? Congregation demographics and age? Congregation's maturity (strengths and weaknesses)? Congregation size? Are there are any significant and recent events in the church's life that I should know about before I preach? Basic order of service (is preaching the first thing in the service? Is it after a few songs?)? How long are the sermons normally?
- Questions to Ask Before You Preach by Jason Allen, President of MBTS
	- Have you studied too little?
	- Do you have too many preaching notes? (i.e. is your sermon too long?) [Usually somewhere around 8-12 pages is a good amount for a 40 minute sermon, depending on the preacher)
	- Do you have a misplaced confidence? (In yourself, rather than God)
	- Do you have unconfessed sin?
	- Are you confident you know the meaning of the text?
	- Do you make a dash to the cross?
- Don't chase mice, if you haven't plowed the field yet. It can be tempting to spend an inordinate amount of time on minor things which you may only speak about for a minute or two. It's good to dive deep on those things, but be sure that the bulk of your time is spent on the most important aspects of your text. Major on the majors, and minor on the minors
- Is my sermon manuscript long/short enough to reach 35-40 minutes?
	- Know yourself? Do you tend to speak long/short? 
	- Add text to speech minutes calculator
	- For me and many others 8-14 pages of manuscript or detailed outline is about a 40 minute sermon.
- Video Link: [In addition to prayer/exegesis work, what practices have been most helpful to your sermon prep? | H. B. Charles, Jr., Bryan Chapell, and Ray Ortlund ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9UDS8G7JmU&t=77s) 
- [[üó£Ô∏èüó£Ô∏è All TEACHINGS stack/Templates/Summary of Ryan Hugley's 8 Hours or Less Writing Faithful Sermons Faster\|Summary of Ryan Hugley's 8 Hours or Less Writing Faithful Sermons Faster]] His book gives some great ideas, but don't expect to only spend 8 hours a week on your sermon. He doesn't give enough time for commentary study.
- If people are laughing, give them space to do so. You don't need to hurry the moment.
- "Your humanity connects. Your godliness inspires. We may impress people with our strengths but we connect with people through our weaknesses." Be yourself.
- Don't get stuck in analysis paralysis. While preparing, have the mindset of "the first draft." *It is ok if your first draft is bad. You cant start with your final draft.* You have to begin at the beginning. You can only steer a ship that is moving. Just get moving, and work hard. Leave the results to God. In the end, aim for excellence, not perfection in your preaching.
- Don't let an illustration that you like, drive your preparation.
- How long should sermon prep take?
	- Steve Lawson: No more than 20 hours (he spends 10-12)
	- Bryan Chappell spends [eight hours](https://homiletix.com/bryan-chapell-how-i-preach/)
	- Michael Easley [15-30](https://homiletix.com/michael-easley-how-i-preach/)
	- Warren Weirsbe use to tell us one hour prep for every sermon minute (is this a legit quote?
	- Macarthur 15-30 hours? [LINK](https://unashamedworkman.wordpress.com/2007/03/21/macarthurs-sermon-preparation/)
	- Charles Swindol and Rick Warren take 16 hours to prepare. J. Vernon McGee say that he needed 20 to 25 hours [LINK](https://unashamedworkman.wordpress.com/2007/03/21/macarthurs-sermon-preparation/)
	- Phillip Ryken: "Ideally, twenty hours per sermon, but in practice more like ten to twelve hours."
	- Ray Ortlund Jr "Early in my ministry, I needed twenty-plus hours to prepare. By now, the disciplines are more streamlined. I average perhaps ten hours or so."
- "[Do what you can do with the time you have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV9NocJO3qA&t=1s)." What matters more than *how much* time you spend on sermon prep, is *how well you steward God's time.*
- Physical Notes for Preaching
	- "Remember it's OK to look at your notes‚Ä¶that's what you have them for and the audience will be perfectly fine with it. But do so in a deliberate manner; don't glance surreptitiously at them as if you're trying to make it seem that you're not consulting them. Break eye contact with the audience, glance at your notes and absorb the next point, then re-establish eye contact with the audience and deliver that section. The pause may seem particularly long to you, but it doesn't to the audience. And it will give them an opportunity to process what you've just said."
- **Introduction / Hook** 
	- An interesting illustration / story related to the text
	- A powerful quote
	- Pointing out the comfort which the text brings
	- Advice from [Steve Lawson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsL33tyCLVY)
	- "When you want to deliver a memorable talk, wonder: *What would my audience find surprising or counterintuive about this topic*?"
- What [clock should I use when preaching?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Vq8B4rk474&list=PLnX-AziLHo29e7R9prz0uBgq_kYLG_VB5&index=68) 
	- My thoughts
		- avoid using your phone (you don't want any distractions when preaching)
		- I prefer a stopwatch on my wrist watch. I do NOT want to calculate "Ok‚Ä¶ it's 9:47 so, i've been preaching for 17 minutes, and I have x amount of minutes to go"

	- It begins with an extensive survey, months prior to when we‚Äôll teach though a book of the Bible. Since we have a team of pastor-teachers, we try to get off site for a day and do a high level look at the book. We use synthetic or introductory commentaries like Talk Thru the Bible, or a literary approach √† la  Charles Talbert (Reading Luke, for e.g.), to get an overview of major themes. We then map out the number of weeks we want to target. Once we‚Äôve done initial broad spade work, we break down the sections, assign each a draft title, look for major themes or topics, characteristics of God, what God wants of his people, etc. Typically the week or more before I actually teach, I begin reading the English text repeatedly, taking note of the first-blush questions that arise; people in the pew who are probably reading it for the first time may have similar questions. After that, I begin with a basic Bible-Study-Method approach, asking: Who? What? Where? When? How? Why? I look for ‚Äústand-out‚Äù grammar issues (in the English text). Then I turn to commentaries‚Äîsynthetic, critical, and expository varieties thereof. Depending on the passage, I‚Äôll spend up to 30% of my time in the languages, exploring main terms, the basic grammatical outline, etc.; if the passage has been diagramed I will look at that. The most difficult aspect for me is moving from an exegetical outline to an expository outline. For some reason, after 30+ years, I still struggle with writing out the first draft of outline points. Once I get the first draft of 3, 4, 5 or so main outline points, then I begin writing. Perhaps the most important thing for me is to keep in mind the ‚Äúend-hearer.‚Äù
- Bryan Chapell preparation steps
	- Rough outline of the text on Tuesday. 
	- All day Thursday to study and write.  
	- Parts of Saturday to hone and refresh the message.
- ["How I Preach" Interview series](https://homiletix.com/how-i-preach-archives/)
* You devoted a lot of time on perfecting the frills, but only later got to cooking the meat. In the end, due to time limit you had to cut out the frills. So you misused time, that would have been better spent on the meat. **Prepare the main dish first, then the sides**.
- You wore yourself out preaching through the sermon in practice on the day you were going to preach.
	- Be sure you have the outline ready **before the day you teach it**. 
	- When you practice, try to do it as if you're in a conversation, not preaching. Just to be sure you know how to talk about the ideas coherently.
	- **Maintain your spirit**
- At some point you need to stop thinking about it and entrust it to God
- Come prepared.  Don't be afraid of questions. 
- If you're going to discuss a hard doctrine, understand how fresh it may be to some there. It may be their first time coming across a doctrine like this! Also, emphasize the opposite side sometimes.
- If you do a manuscript, write it out later in the process, rather than the beginning. It will help cement your thoughts. It will save you time doing it later, by avoiding writing out parts of the sermon you are not going to preach and thus wasting your time. Get an outline and idea of the main idea before you manuscript.

# Extemporaneous Helps

[^4]
* Be comfortable with awkward silence
## Back Pocket Questions
**Preaching**
- Let's pause for a moment and consider how this applies to our lives.
- How does affect your relationship with God? How you think about Him and pray to Him? 
- How does this affect your relationship with others?

**Teaching only**
- Let's pause for a moment and make space for questions. Does anyone have something which seemed unclear to them? Or a question for me? 
- If no questions, "something you may have a question on." or, "Many people have questions about ‚Ä¶"

## Question and Answer Section Tips
- If you have asked "are there any questions" but you get silence. Try saying this: "One question that you may have or One question i'm frequently is ‚Ä¶"

# Personal Symbols I Use In My Manuscripts
- Simple
	- **Bold**: Headings, and a generic emphasis.
	- *Italics*: A turn of phrase that needs to be said precisely, or a word that can't be missed
	- [brackets] Directions to myself, or brackets indicate that you can leave this thought out if needed [this is similar to a square bracket's standard usage in grammar]
	- ==Highlight==: Only used during preparation, to indicate areas that need to be worked on.
	- Block quote: Used only for quotes.
- Extra
	-  *//*  Transition sentence.
	- [Brackets] : Directions to myself, or brackets indicate that you can leave this thought out if needed [this is similar to a square bracket's standard usage in grammar]
	- (parenthesis ‚Ä¶) or {curly cues}:  <u>Pregnant thought</u>. In other words, expand on this (looks like a mom's tummy bulging). 
	- ~~ Pause and take a breath.
	- ‚Üí : Don't forget this thought, you have forgotten it in practice.

# Ideas for Improving Your Preaching, or Your Preparation{ #1c04f5}

- **Maintain your spirit**
- Type out a full manuscript, send to Scribe, and then reduce it into big ideas/pictures by  writing on manuscript to break it down into symbols/sections 
- Improving workflow: Integrate the template core plugin into your workflow, so you are using that for templates, instead of copy/paste
- "Time can be your greatest friend, or your greatest enemy."
- Application questions from Knute:  "Do you ever ask that question? "Do you do that?" ‚Ä¶ "Is that you?""Do you ever feel like that?"
- **Printing Ideas**
	* Maybe print out the pdf normal size but put 2 pages / page then they're all half the size and you may be able to fit them in your bible
	* Personal printing instructions: when trying small size in bible (*if doing binder just do normal, double-sided printing*) This isnt nailed down yet and needs to be improved
		- (Obsidian FontSize is set to "20") 
		- Export to PDF ("size A5")
		- Print PDF ("Scale: Actual size," "Print on **One** **side**,")
		- After Printing Cut to size with exacto knife and ruler
- Feedback from Knute and others
	- Smile more
	- Vary more, especially when telling a story
- Checklist for studying the passage
	- We learn best when we have a big picture. Make the first step,  before reading through the passage 5x drafting a 2-minute guess-exegetical outline? Then write out the ESV outline quickly and compare‚Ä¶? 
- **Inductive Sermons** Instead of Big ideas and supporting ideas, you could follow the QEC format ( ü†î Maybe for inductive sermons)
	- Question:
	- Evidence:
	- Conclusion: 
- Find a better word and abbreviation for SE
	- Main Idea
		- BI: Big Idea
	- Supporting Evidence SE
		- ==Subheading (SH==)
		- Supporting Idea ( SI )
		- S (S)
 - Symbols available for use, if needed. ?, !, $, @ 
- Epistle Outline improvement ideas
	- What is the classic puritan sermon? see the Puritan anthology
	- What does the outline contain from public speaking class? Anything you want to add to this?

- It may be scarier, but better, to have a simple outline‚Ä¶. Hmmm.. What is the balance here? Write out a manuscript and reduce it to an outline? Have an outline, with different parts written out? God give me wisdom.  "Prepare carefully, and preach freely" - MLJ
