# Getting At The Core of The Message

## Title of Sermon



## FCF
The *Fallen Condition Focus* is an idea from Bryan Chappell's excellent book *Christ Centered Preaching.*

*‚Äú[The FCF is] the mutual human condition that contemporary believers share with those to or about whom the text was written that requires the grace of the passage for God‚Äôs people to glorify and enjoy him." It is the problem we share with the original audience. The sin or suffering we both go through.* 
The FCF can start with:
As Christians still in this broken world ‚Ä¶
As Christians still with sin still remaining in our hearts ‚Ä¶
As sinful human beings we  all can ‚Ä¶


## 3AM Sentence
*If someone woke you up at 3am and asked "What is your sermon about?" what would you say? What is your main-idea-sentence?*


God saved us from himself, by himself, and for himself.

## KFD

### Know
*What do I want them to know?*
We were 

### Feel
*What do I want them to feel?*

### Do
 *What do I want them to do?*

# Checklist ‚úÖ
**There are three basic steps to sermon preparation: Research, writing, and rehearsing**. Many steps you will need to go back to and revise after you have "completed" it. The following is a simple checklist to guide you through that process.

As you prepare, don't get stuck by analysis-paralysis. Aim for excellence not perfection in your preparation. Also, make this checklist your own: each man will prepare sermons differently, and need different reminders. I tend towards perfectionism, so I need reminders to move on; you may be the opposite.

## **Stage One: Research**
- [x] Pray, pray, pray.
- [x] Then follow Checklist below ü†´ 
- [x] Pray, pray, pray again. Just as important as preparing the message, is preparing yourself.
- [x] Pick the passage you will plan to preach on (the exact verses may change some as you study the passage and that is ok)
- [x] Get a blank piece of paper that will serve as a **thought collector** (this can be physical or digital)
	- [x] Write on the top of the paper the verse references (i.e. Mark 12:28-34)
	- [x] This is a brainstorming piece of paper. You could carry it with you in your pocket to work, and use it as a place to jot down quick thoughts. It will also serve as a place to brainstorm when you are doing focused study. You want to write down ideas when they come to you because they're like fireflies: they appear for a few seconds and unless you capture them, they're gone.

>[!info] Read and Digest the Thought of The Text
> There are several different ways to do Read and Digest the Thought of The Text. Reading it slowly 3x, reading it constantly 50x, writing it out by hand, memorizing it, interrogating it with questions etc. Whatever you do, get the text into you. It must first transform you, before it can transform others. "Preaching from the head, reaches the head. Preaching from the heart, reaches the heart."

- [x] Read and Digest the Thought of the Text
	- [x] Read the text
	- [x] Read the broader context
	- [x] Consider writing out the text by hand 
	- [x] Sketch a rough draft of the text's flow-of-thought (exegetical outline)
- [x] Answer the KFD and 3am questions.
- [x] Do a quick check with the commentaries. Is your main idea lining up with what they say the main idea of the passage is?
- [x] Revise your KFD and 3am questions in light of the commentaries (if necessary).
- [x] Sketch a rough draft of a sermon outline (homiletical outline)
>[!info] Note:
> Go back to to the text constantly. As you read, connections and thoughts will come to mind. Write-these-thoughts-down!
- [ ] Ways to Research the Text further
	- [ ] Pick some of the following
	- SPEC-Sword [Bible Study Questions](https://www.yfc.org.au/sword)  (sins, promises, examples, commands)
	- Pathways Bible Study Method: Observe, Understand, Apply. 
	- Read other versions (NASB, ESB, CSB, NIV, KJV)
	- Talk to a friend about the text 
	- Read good commentaries ([PreceptsAustin](https://www.preceptaustin.org/verse_by_verse) is  a good Starting Point. To buy commentaries check [bestcommentaries](https://bestcommentaries.com/))
	- [ ]  Look through cross references
	- Original Language study
	- Read books which overview the topic
	- Go back and revise your sermon outline, KFD, and 3am sentence as needed 
## **Stage Two: Writing**

- [x] Revise your sermon outline in light of your research
- [ ] Have a conversation with a friend, and explain what you're thinking for your sermon outline. Invite feedback.
- [ ] Write the Intro and Conclusion
	- [ ] Draft The Intro 
	- [ ] Draft The Conclusion
- [ ] Fill in the body of your manuscript (you can write out a manuscript or you can do a detailed outline)
* [ ] Send completed slides to Corey @ tbc.edwardsburg@gmail.com
## **Stage Three: Rehearsing**
- [ ] Practice
	- [ ] "Conversate" it with a friend. Don't *read* off a manuscript, *talk* them through your outline. Ask for feedback.
	-  A second option is to practice talking through your outline by yourself.
- [ ] Make revisions in light of feedback
- [ ] Print it
- [ ] Pray over it
- [ ] Preach it "*Prepare carefully, preach freely*" - Martyn Lloyd Jones

#### Hook / AGD :



*Ideas*

In pursuing God come up he has the story of the skydiver cameraman who got so caught up in the moment he jumped out of the plane without a parachute. I wonder if there are some people who are so caught up in the paces of life, they're jumping towards judgment day without a parachute. Are you ready for when you hit the ground? Have you failed to give thought to the most important thing? It's easy to get caught up in the excitement and wonders of life, or the sinful pleasures But have you gotten the most important thing down? Is your parachute strapped on? This is the new birth.


- I remember in school, One of my teachers in school, a huge man who played pro-football, was grilling me on my homework.
- He towered over me, and asked "Do you think if you ignore your problems, they'll go away?"
- *Even though we ignore life's crucial questions*
	- ***What** are we here for? **Why** is there **so much wrong in the world**?  **Why** is there **so much wrong** **in me***? *~ ~* 
	- they don't go away.  
- They tower over us, 
	- they haunt us, 
	- until we have a satisfying answer

*//* Well, The Bible provides a shocking answer to one of life's most important questions - *Who is man?* 
- It's surprising assessment on the condition of mankind. 
- We like to think that each Year were progressing farther and farther
	- Technology has gotten better
	- Science has expanded
	- we know more than we ever have.

- But for all of our knowledge has the human condition improved at all?
	- Have men become more self-controlled?
	- Has society become more loving?
	- Have people become kinder?

- **Or**, Do we see more anxiety?
- more broken families?
- More sexual sin?

- You see, what **government regulation, or a prestigious education** could *never do is* **transform** the **human** **heart**. #anthropology 
- What **self-will, and discipline** could never accomplish, is an inward-transformation
- *Those are all outside forces trying to work their way in*. But what God wants to do is to start with a radical inward transformation
#### Thesis:
**God lays out a shocking spiritual diagnosis on the human condition in our text: Disobedient, and dead**.

*//* But **just shocking, is that a holy God would take such people, and redeem them and make them alive**.


Naturally, we are condemned before God but Christ saved us.


#### Roadmap:
*//*  "==Today there are 3 Headings== ‚Ä¶ "
- Who we are 
- who God is 
- what God is done

### Context

## Body

### ‚¨õ Section: Who We Are
*!!* Read v3
#### BI: Disobedient
*//* The first trait of humankind we see is our disobedience: "*For we ourselves were once foolish, disobedient, led astray"*
##### SE: Mankind is Naturally Disobedient
- In our disobedience, we naturally stray from God
- The book of Isaiah says that,  *"All we like sheep have gone astray. We have turned everyone to our own way"*
	-  You see that language here, "we were once **disobedient, led astray**"

*//* We are **condemned** before God because of our disobedience
*//*  Not only do our consciences bear witness to this, but God's commandments do


*//* You might say, "*I know i'm not perfect, but I ***feel that*** I a good person. I try and do what's right."

- Well, let's be objective about this. Let's not think about our feelings, but the facts
	- What does God's law say?

**Ten Commandments**
- If in fact, you are a morally good person, then you wouldn't mind comparing yourself to God's ten commandments
- Let's look at just 4 of the ten commandments
- "You shall have no other God's before me"
	- **At the very heart of sin is** *preferring* *anything* above God. *Sin is preferring anything above God*
	- It's when we see God, the king on his throne, and we kick him off to something/someone else there.
	- *Would you say that God is **the most important** thing in your life*?
		- **You never compromise** *obedience to God* for anything?
			- your career?
			- your love life?
			- your love of pleasure?
- *//* The first commandment is to have no other gods before Him, and none of us have obeyed this
- *We are disobedient, and therefore condemned*
- ~~"You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain"~~
	- ~~Do you ever use Christ's name as a curse word~~?
	- ~~Do you ever say, "Jesus Christ" when you're frustrated~~?
	- ~~Oh, "Oh my GOD~~"?
	- ~~That's taking something holy, and treating it as nothing. It's sin~~.
- a 2nd commandment "You shall not commit adultery"
	- This is *any sexual act outside of marriage*
		- God treats *sex* as a **sacred**, and **holy thing**.
		- Something *to be preserved* for **the union between one man and one woman**
		- **God hates when we** *profane the sacredness of sexuality*
		- But we trample what God makes holy
    - *(* mental *)* Perhaps, you think "I haven't broken that commandment. "
	    - Well Jesus says this, "If anyone looks at a woman with lust, he has committed adultery with her in his heart"
	    - Have you ever looked on another person with lust? *~ ~* 
		    - God calls that adultery. Sin.
		- What if we had a microchip that would relay all of your thoughts on a screen?
			- All of your friends could see, all that you have thought in your mind?
			- Think about that.
- *We are disobedient, and therefore condemned*
- a 3rd commandment - You shall not lie
	- Think about this, seriously.
	- Do you ever lie?
		- When you're caught doing something?
		- When you're arguing for a point, and you exaggerate?
	- In our sin, we naturally try and cover our bad deeds with lies.
- A 4th Commandment:*(* Mt 5:21-22 You shall not commit murder *)* 
    - Let's look at one last commandment
    - "*You shall not murder"*
	    - Finally!, you say. "I've got you there." Never have I murdered anyone"
    - Jesus says, **if you are angry with someone** it is *like murder in your heart*
    - We see this in our text: *"we were slaves to various passions and pleasures, passing our days in malice and envy. Hated by others, and hating one another"*
    - Before God stepped into the Cretans lives, they were full of anger, full of malice.
	    - Is that your heart? Would your family describe you as an angry person?
	    - My friend, you stand condemned before God.
	    - To become angry with someone, is murder in your heart.

* We have only looked at 4 commandments, *briefly*
	* Not only do we have the rest of the ten commandments
		* but The Bible has hundreds of instructions. How many of those do you think you've kept?
	* And, if you're not even aware of what they are, how could you even keep them?
* Do you still think you're a good person?

*//* *our text says that all of us were "disobedient, and led astray" that we were characterized by anger and malice*


-  This Disobedience to God is *sin*
- Do you know what *sin* deserves?
	- Death.
	- *"For the wages of sin is death"*
	- *Wage is getting* what you deserve


- Consider what our wage should be. 
	- How many times a day do you think you sin?
		- Let's say 3 times a day for 70 years (From *age of 10 to 80 years old*).
		- Each year that's a total of 1,095 sins committed
		- Over the course of a lifetime, that amount to 76,650 
		- *that's a modest estimate*
		- This is why the Bible says that we drink sin like water


*//* *We are foolish, disobedient, led astray,*

*//* *Our disobedience leads to our condemnation*

"Good works"
But what about my good works? 
- **Isaiah 64:6**
    - "all our righteous acts are like filthy rags"

*//* You see not only do our bad works condemn us, but our good works are like filthy rags

**Why talk so much about sin**

*//* Now, you might be very annoyed with me
- Why would you spend this bright morning talking so much about sin?
	- *You've spoiled the service* with all this talk about disobedience, and punishment.
	- Let's talk about fine, and happy things.
- Friends, the good news is only good because our natural state is so bad.

**Life Jacket and A Tsunami**

- If I threw a hard life-jacket at you, and it hit you in the face, while yelled "hold on"*!!* 
	- How would you feel? *flustered? annoyed?*
- But what If by Some strange phenomenon *a flood was about to hit,***And before the waves swept us away** I threw you a life jacket
	- How would you feel then? Overwhelmed with thankfulness? 
	- How tightly would you hold on to that life jacket?

- *The Good news of Jesus is a life jacket*. 
	- And **we cannot throw it at someone** *without first convincing them* that a massive storm is coming.


*We are disobedient, and therefore condemned under the just anger of God*
### ‚¨õ Section: What God Has Done

- We've looked just briefly, at who we are, Consider what God does in response to this!

*!!* v4-5a
#### BI: The Goodness and Lovingkindness of God our savior

- What does it mean the goodness and lovingkindness of God our savior *appeared*?
	- It's referencing the cross!
	- It's talking about Jesus!
- Jesus is the manifestation of the goodness of God
- What happened is this
	- *(* Tell the story of the cross

>[!quote] Stott
>In Titus 3 Washing (loutron) is almost certainly a reference to water baptism. All the early church fathers took it in this way. This does not mean that they (or Paul) taught baptismal regeneration, any more than Ananias did when he said to Saul of Tarsus, ‚ÄòGet up, be baptised and wash your sin away, calling on his name.‚Äô21 Most Protestant churches think of baptism as ‚Äòan outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace‚Äô, namely of the washing away of sins, and of new birth by the Holy Spirit. But they do not confuse the sign (baptism) with the thing signified (salvation). #baptism 


>[!quote] Stott
>**These are four tremendous words**. God‚Äôs ‚Äòkindness‚Äô (chrƒìstotƒìs) is shown even to ‚Äòthe ungrateful and wicked‚Äô; his ‚Äòlove‚Äô (philanthr≈çpia) is his concern for the whole human race; his ‚Äòmercy‚Äô (eleos) is extended to the helpless who cannot save themselves; and his ‚Äògrace‚Äô (charis) reaches out to the guilty and undeserving.

>[!quote] John Stott
>If we were truly deceived and enslaved, one thing is obvious: we could not save ourselves. 
>*Yet the possibility of self-salvation is one of the major delusions of New Age philosophy*. 
>It teaches that salvation comes not from without (someone else coming to our rescue) but from within (as we discover ourselves and our own resources). *So ‚Äòlook into yourself‚Äô, Shirley MacLaine urges us, ‚Äòexplore yourself‚Äô, for ‚Äòall the answers are within yourself*‚Äô. And in her subsequent book, which is revealingly entitled Going Within, she writes that ‚Äòthe New Age is all about self-responsibility‚Äô, i.e. taking responsibility for everything that happens, since ‚Äòthe only source is ourselves‚Äô.

**"Gods' standard"**

- If you were to die and stand before God, and he asked you ""why should I let you into heaven?" What would you say?
- Matthew 5:48 " You therefore must be perfect, as your heavenly father is perfect"
- God's standard is perfection! Why? because he

>[!quote] Paul Washer
>"The gospel of Jesus Christ is the greatest of all treasures given to the church and the individual Christian. It is not a message among many but the message above them all. It is the power of God for salvation and the greatest revelation of the manifold wisdom of God to men and angels."

- Verses 4‚Äì7 are a single long sentence, which he may have taken from an early Christian creed.
- It has been well said "The only thing we contributed to our salvation was the sin that made it necessary."

* What is regeneration? define.7

* *God saved us from himself , for himself, and by himself*. Reference this phrase that you may have used in the Titus sermon on Titus 211 through 15, except this time emphasize "by himself"


* White tShirt Illustration, and dark tShirt



- 1 Peter 2:25: "For you were *straying* like sheep, but have now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls." Same word.

* **conclusion** 
	* In pursuing God come up he has the story of the skydiver cameraman who got so caught up in the moment he jumped out of the plane without a parachute. I wonder if there are some people who are so caught up in the paces of life, they're jumping towards judgment day without a parachute. Are you ready for when you hit the ground? Have you failed to give thought to the most important thing? It's easy to get caught up in the excitement and wonders of life, or the sinful pleasures But have you gotten the most important thing down? Is your parachute strapped on? This is the new birth.
	* and I wont lead you in a simplistic prayer. This may take wrestling with Go.


- *But I grew up in a Christian home, I had little outward disobedience. How does this apply to me?*[^3]
	- Have you forgotten who is writing this? Brethren in many respects, this was the story of Paul! (See passage listing his accomplishments)
	- It is not just the outward acts that matter but the inner heart
	- Hebrews 4:12-13
		- For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and of spirit, of joints and of marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart.
		- And no creature is hidden from his sight, but all are naked and exposed to the eyes of him to whom we must give account.

Unbeliever, You may have suffered tragedy, you may have been born with this or that terrible difficulty, but *your main problem is not the things around, it is the things inside of you.* You don't need a new change of scenery,

##### SE: We Had Different Degrees of outward Disobedience
- Some of you read this and have trouble applying it to yourself, much like I did. Was I really "hating others and hated by others" outside Christ?
- What if I grew up in a Christian home and had the tremendous blessing of being saved at a young age?
- Each of us had different degrees of *outward* obedience
	-  

 - *(* Robert Murray Mcheyne Excerpt *)* I was reading some of Robert Murray McCheyne's Biography. Check out this excerpt! He has up to this point lived a very "nice life" the "worst" outward sins he has committed (in the eyes of the world) was probably anger or playing cards. But listen to what he thinks of himself
	- Robert takes some to sit down for self-examination. He says this of himself: "What a mass of corruption have I been! How great a portion of my life have I spent wholly without God in the world ‚Ä¶ ! Naturally of a feeling and sentimental [personality], how much of my religion has been, and to this day is, tinged with these colors of earth! [ I think he means because of sensitive disposition he was often moved emotionally but not spiritually]  "[I was] Restrained from **open** [sin] by ‚Ä¶ the fear of man, [but] how much ungodliness has reigned **within** me! ‚Ä¶ **Though my vice was always refined, yet how subtle and how awfully prevalent it was!** "  
	- What a powerful way to describe sin: "Though my vice was always¬†refined¬†.¬†.¬†."

  ü†™ ==End this point After the== Mcheyne illustration! And go to next point.

- [Brothers, "God hates self-rigtheousness as much as unrighteousness"[^5] ]
	- Internal evil is just as condmening in the sight of God as outward
	-  "Man looks on the outward appearance, God looks at the heart."
	- Jesus said, in Matthew 5 that if anyone hates someone in their heart, it is like committing murder in the heart.
- You may have come in here, unsure what Christianity is, and thinking to yourself "I'm really a good person. I try not to harm people, I don't do drug, I don't drink, and even if I did, I try to do it in moderation."
- Well God's account of your spiritual state is very different.
