## Quotes
>"**Paul had before his eyes the death which he was prepared to endure for the testimony of the gospel. All that we read here, therefore**, concerning the kingdom of Christ, the hope of eternal life, the Christian warfare, confidence in confessing Christ, and the certainty of doctrine, **ought to be viewed by us as written not with ink but with Paul’s own blood; for nothing is asserted by him for which he does not offer the pledge of his death**" Calvin on 2 Tim #BoldnessandCourage #Gospel 

- **Timothy is at Ephesus with Onesiphorus:** "Yet it may readily be concluded that he was at Ephesus when this Epistle was written to him; because, towards the close of the Epistle, ([2 Timothy 4:19](https://www.studylight.org/study-desk.html?q1=2ti+4:19&t1=eng_nas&sr=1),) Paul “salutes Priscilla, and Aquila, and Onesiphorus,” the last of whom was an Ephesian, and Luke informs us that the other two remained at Ephesus when Paul sailed to Judea, ([Acts 18:18](https://www.studylight.org/study-desk.html?q1=ac+18:18&t1=eng_nas&sr=1).)" (Calvin on 2 Tim)
- **William Hendriksen on the divisions of 2 Ti**: There are no sharp divisions. Rather, the emphasis gradually shifts from one point to another. When a new point is made, the old one is not entirely relinquished. ==The thoughts overlap like shingles on a roof.== For example, a key passage in chapter 1 is, “Do not be ashamed” (verses 8, 12, 16). The idea recurs, however, in chapter 2 (verse 15). Similarly, a key passage in chapter 2 is, “Suffer hardship along with us” (verse 3; cf. verse 9). But this has been anticipated in chapter 1 (verse 8). [Yes, I think this is why it is so tough to outline the book] #Exegesis

- "More especially, **he recommends to him to be constantly employed in teaching sound doctrine**, pointing out the proper use of Scripture, that he may know that he will find in it everything that is necessary for the solid edification of the Church." Calvin

## My Thoughts
- **Nothing New Under The Sun. Falling away** This fresh wave of ex-evangelicals, the falling away of once great men, the betrayal of Ravvi Zacharias, the loss of Joshua Harris and more can feel like the pounding of  waves on a sand castle, but I want to remind you that God's Firm Foundation Stand. There is nothing new under the sun. This falling away is not a new thing, it is a very, very old thing. "For Demas, in love with this present world has deserted me and gone to Thessalonica" 2 Tim 4:10. and Demas joins a long line in 2 Tim of Hermongenes, and Phygelus (1:15), Hymaneus and Philetus (2:18), "all who are in Asia" (1:15), those whose faith has ben upset by Hymaneus and Philetus, everyone who failed to stand by Paul at his first defense. These are just the names in 2 Timothy. We have the Judas' of our day, the Spinozasa or Schleirmacher's, the fathers of modern liberal theology, who in their day (and until now) have caused numbers to go astray.

- 3:8 "But they will not get very far … is parallel to 2:14-20. Paul has 2 pictures in mind when he thinks of men defecting from the faith: The Egypitan magicians, and Achan's rebellion (2:19)
